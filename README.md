### SQL Practice & Database Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and database exercises demonstrating my experience with querying, data analysis, and database objects using real-world datasets.

The focus is on writing clean, efficient SQL and working with relational database concepts such as aggregations, joins, stored procedures, and schema creation.
